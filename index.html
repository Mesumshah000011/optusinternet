        <p>Both providers offer the same speed tiers. Optus might perform a bit better during peak hours, but the gap isn't huge. For most homes, both do the job just fine.</p>
        <div class="pro-tip">
            <strong>Pro tip:</strong> Got gamers or streamers in the house? Go with NBN100 or higher.
        </div>

        <h2>Which One Is Cheaper?</h2>
        <p>Let's look at the popular NBN50 plan:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Optus NBN50:</strong> Around $79/month. Modem included. No setup fees.</li>
            <li><strong>Tangerine NBN50:</strong> $59.90/month for the first six months. Then $69.90/month. BYO modem or buy one.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Tangerine internet clearly wins on price. But if you want more than just basic internet, <b><a href="https://www.moveinconnect.com.au/suppliers/optus/"> Optus internet</a></b> brings some extra perks to the table.</p>

        <h2>Modem and Setup: What to Expect?</h2>
        <h3>Optus</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Free modem with most plans</li>
            <li>4G backup modem included</li>
            <li>Easy setup, just plug it in</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Tangerine</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Bring your own modem or buy one for $129.90</li>
            <li>Setup is DIY, but simple</li>
            <li>No setup charges</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you want something that works straight out of the box, go with Optus. Tangerine is fine too, but you'll need to be a bit hands-on.</p>

        <h2>Extras and Add-Ons</h2>
        <p>Optus internet gives you more than just connection:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Add-ons like Netflix, Amazon Prime, Fetch TV</li>
            <li>Free Optus Sport and OS fitness</li>
            <li>Discounts on mobile plans</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Tangerine internet keeps it simple. No extras. Just reliable internet.</p>
        <p>If you want entertainment built into your plan, Optus wins this round.</p>

        <h2>Contracts and Flexibility</h2>
        <p>Both let you go contract-free. But there are a few details:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>With Optus, if you leave early on a 24-month plan, they might charge for the modem.</li>
            <li>With Tangerine, there's no catch. You can cancel whenever.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Tangerine also gives you a 14-day trial. So if it's not working for you, no harm done.</p>

        <h2>Best for Working From Home?</h2>
        <h3>Optus</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Strong and stable speeds</li>
            <li>Backup options if NBN goes down</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Tangerine</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Speeds are good for most work</li>
            <li>Great for anyone watching the budget</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If your job depends on staying connected 24/7, Optus is the safer pick. But for general Zoom calls and emails, Tangerine is just fine.</p>

        <h2>Better for Gaming?</h2>
        <p>Gaming needs more than speed. You want:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Low ping</li>
            <li>Consistent connection</li>
            <li>Enough bandwidth for downloads and live play</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Optus tends to handle peak hours better and usually offers slightly lower latency. Still, if you're in a city, Tangerine can hold up well.</p>
        <p>For serious gamers, Optus is worth it. If you're more casual, Tangerine works.</p>
